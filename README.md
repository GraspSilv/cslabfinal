Final project for ND Fundamentals of Computing 1

This game is written in C with a simple graphics library (gfx.h and gfx.c).
It is a stickfigure war game.  In order to accomplish the animation, generator.c is a program that allows a user to animate a stickfigure or other object by moving its pivot points. The animation is stored into a text file, and can be called by a program.  The main program, player.c, is the actual game which uses these animation files along with other logic to simulate a game.
